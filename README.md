<h1> UNITY GAME DEVELOP INTERGRATE WITH COMPUTER VISION YOLOV8</h1>

<h2> Requirements</h2>
<h3> INTRODUCTION </h3>
his project aims to enhance user experience in entertaining mechanisms based on turn 
base and the Japanese role-playing-game (JRPG) category by collaborating with computer 
vision; the product will provide players with a more realistic user experience, which 
potentially improves the engagement of potential users. This project was formed by gathering 
ideas for similar products on the market and real-life events.  
The project is designed to work with modern computer vision methods, specifically in 
using the state-of-the-art model YOLOV8 for hand gesture recognition, which allows the 
project to interact with users in near real-time while maintaining reasonable performance 
furthermore by conducted the product by using Unity provide advantages in performance, 
various of customise structure and build in features which benefit development time. 
The result of the testing and evaluation provides promising product quality with high
speed interaction in recognising hand gestures. Moreover, it is highly hoped that positive user 
feedback will be received. This implementation demonstrates that entertaining products can 
go beyond the traditional approach. 
Keywords: [“Computer vision”, “Game development”, “Design pattern”]  

<h3> SCOPE </h3>
The project involves computer vision aspect and game development. The computer vision will 
be used to detect hands and recognise hand gestures for only one hand, which will be adopted 
as an alternative to the controller. For the Game aspect, the gameplay will remain at least 30 
minutes of fully developed gameplay, including UX/UI, Game story, etc.
